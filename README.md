# Python_Learning_Group
This repository is created for uploading the completed tasks of a python practise group.
Task(1) 
The first task has been completed and it is to make a dictionary from key:value pairs (with some keys having multiple values) given in form of tuple to the code.
Tuple_of _key_value_pairs=((1,2),(2,1),(2,6),(2,7))
dictionary_made_from_the_given_tuple={1: [2], 2: [1, 6, 7,]}
code_file_name:- graph_dict.py
Task(2)
In task 2, the graph dict made in first task is used to implement a dfs(depth first search). Then this dfs is used to make a small program in which we can perform a check for node to node connection given the nodes in graph_dict(made in first task).
Task(3)
In task 3, the same search of node to node connectivity check will be performed using the bfs(breadth first search).
